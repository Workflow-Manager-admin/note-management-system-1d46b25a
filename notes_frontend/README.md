# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Environment Setup

### Connecting to Supabase

This app requires Supabase credentials to function. You **must** create a `.env` file in this folder using the `.env.sample` as a template.

1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`:

   ```
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. Set your values for:
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY`

   The `.env.sample` includes working sample values matching the project.

**Note:** The variable names **must** begin with `REACT_APP_` for React to access them at build time. Do not use variable names without this prefix.

3. Restart your development server after editing `.env`.

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
